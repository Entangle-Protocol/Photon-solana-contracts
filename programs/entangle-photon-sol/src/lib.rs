//! Photon messaging generally comprises a set of distributed on-chain and off-chain facilities
//! that provide a transport layer across various blockchains.
//! The Photon cross-chain messaging Endpoint is a Solana program accessible either via a
//! public API or through the CPI. It facilitates the execution of operations or the submission of
//! proposals to another chain accordingly.
//!
//! Current implementation includes the photon messaging program, the onefunc distributed protocol sample program,
//! and a transmitter-module to both listen for proposals and execute operations and the other.
//!
//! ## Gov Protocol
//!
//! Initially, the Entangle Photon cross-chain messaging protocol is configured during the deployment
//! process with the governance executor and transmitter public keys. This configuration makes possible
//! the execution of additional governance operations, such as adding new protocols, configuring protocol
//! addresses, updating transmitter keys, setting consensus target rates, and other related tasks.
//!
//! ## Executing Operations
//!
//! Operations originate as proposals on another chain. These are monitored by a predetermined number
//! of transmitters and passed to the Master contract on the Entangle Oracle Blockchain.
//! Once sufficient signatures are collected, the operation is ready for execution. It proceeds through
//! three stages in the Endpoint program via the executor module: load, sign, and execute.
//! The executor agent processes each stage sequentially.
//! First, an operation is loaded into the Solana account associated with the op_hash and stored
//! until it is signed and then executed. The program verifies if the required number of signatures
//! is present in the operation data.
//! It's noteworthy that all protocols, including the GOV protocol, are accessible through the same interface.
//! In the case of the GOV protocol, the Photon Endpoint invokes itself using the CPI.
//!
//! Once a signed operation is retrieved from the RabbitMQ message queue, the load_operation, sign_operation,
//! and execute_operation stages are executed. To enable an arbitrary protocol to use accounts
//! it might utilize, the concept of an extension is introduced. An extension is registered as part of
//! the executor module configuration and dynamically linked. The executor extension informs
//! the executor about the specific addresses that will be used during the transaction execution
//! according to the passed `function_selector` and `params`. It also provides all additional signatures before
//! the transaction is sent.
//!
//! ## Listening for Proposals
//!
//! According to the business requirements, the protocol generates a new proposal. External developer's
//! protocol associated program asks the photon layer to emit a proposal as a Solana event that in
//! turn is  captured by the listener module, then transmitted to the output RabbitMQ message queue.
//!
//! # Creating an associated protocol.
//!
//! This documentation is aimed to facilitate creating a Solana based program and make it able to be
//! used within the photon messaging. It means it should be able to be called by `code` or `name` as
//! a callee or make a proposal using the `propose` Endpoint method. It also means the proper executor
//! `extension` should be provided by external developer as well as properly structured associated Solana program.
//!
//! ### Executing operation by name
//!
//! The associated program is supposed to contain methods that handle a single argument, which is a piece of
//! binary data represented as `Vec<u8>`. This data should be interpreted in various ways depending on
//! the design and expectations of the protocol. It's essential that the associated sender encodes
//! the data in a manner that meets the expectations of the protocol's corresponding receiver.
//!
//!```rust
//!use anchor_lang::prelude::Context;
//!pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>, params: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()> {
//!    let inc_item = decode_increment_item(params);
//!    ctx.accounts.counter.count += inc_item;
//!    Ok(())
//!}
//!```
//!
//! The following snippet illustrates what the
//! data might look like. Generated data is intended to be processed by an executor for the correct invocation
//! of the associated contract. In this example, the `function_selector` assumes a code of 0x01 at the
//! first position and specifies the length of the remaining selector data at the second position.
//!
//!```rust
//!let function_selector: Vec<u8> = b"\x01\x17increment_owned_counter".to_vec();
//!let params: Vec<u8> = ethabi::encode(&[Token::Tuple(vec![Token::Uint(Uint::from(*component))])]);
//! ```
//!
//! In the real cross-chain messaging practice this `function_selector` and `params` are to be
//! transferred within a proposal. The params are not to be encoded with ethabi in this instance;
//! rather, this example simply demonstrates a potential approach. Future versions may standardize
//! the encoding of parameters, facilitating their decoding and display within the Entangle Explorer.
//!
//! ### Executing operation by code
//!
//! On the other hand to process a code based invocation an associated program should provide the
//! `receive_photon_msg` method that process `op_hash`, `code`, and `params` as shown in the example below:
//!
//!```rust
//!use anchor_lang::{ prelude::Context, solana_program::msg };
//!use photon::ReceivePhotonMsg;
//!pub fn receive_photon_msg(
//!    _ctx: Context<ReceivePhotonMsg>,
//!    _op_hash: Vec<u8>,
//!    сode: Vec<u8>,
//!    _params: Vec<u8>
//!) -> Result<()> {
//!    msg!("photon msg receive, code: {:?}", code);
//!    Ok(())
//!}
//!```
//!
//! It worth to be noticed that code could be empty value, in that case only `params` should be
//! interpreted as it is supposed by the given protocol.
//!
//! Like in the previous heading here is an example of how the selector and data could be combined
//! to be proposed for executing. It also possible get acquainted to this code [by the link](../src/onefunc/lib.rs.html#57-85)
//!
//!```rust
//!let mut code_function_selector = vec![0u8, code.len() as u8];
//!code_function_selector.extend(code.iter());
//!let params = <Vec<u8>>::default();
//!```
//!
//! ### Extensions
//!
//! Important part of executing an operation on the Solana is a protocol extension that should provide a
//! list of AccountMeta in advance to build and sign the `execute_operation` transaction with a fully
//! qualified list of accounts.
//!
//! The Protocol Extension is a dynamic library that includes methods such as `get_protocol_id`,
//! `get_accounts`, `sign_transaction`, and `get_compute_budget`. Notably, the `ProtocolExtension` serves a
//! critical role. An example of how the ProtocolExtension is implemented for the onefunc protocol
//! can be found [at this link](../src/onefunc_extension/onefunc_extension.rs.html#30-76)
//! Additionally, the implementation of the `gov_extension` is available [under another link](../src/gov_extension/gov_extension.rs.html#27-108)
//! We will explore these methods in detail to deepen our understanding of how they function.
//!
//!  [`get_protocol_id`](../src/transmitter_common/protocol_extension.rs.html#9)
//!
//! is in charge to provide the proper protocol id to be registered as an extension for this protocol.
//! The further dispatching during the executing is proceeding using this protocol id to select the proper extension.
//!
//!  [`get_accounts`](../src/transmitter_common/protocol_extension.rs.html#10-14).
//!
//! The methods of the associated protocol interact with a set of accounts that forms the context for this invocation.
//! The execution operation is set up so that the first three accounts are designated by the photon messaging layer, specifically: `executor`, `call_authority`, and `op_info`.
//! The `executor` is a predetermined authority for this protocol, expected to act as both signer and payer of the operation, and must be the first account provided by an extension.
//! This account should be the first in a set provided by an extension.
//! The `call_authority` is a Program Derived Address (PDA) verified at the photon layer to ensure it is invoked via cross-program invocation—handled by the photon layer.
//! `op_info` is another derived address, designed to provide the associated protocol with any operation-specific details, also facilitated by the photon layer.
//! Subsequently, the remaining accounts follow the executor account and are passed through the photon layer as they are.
//! These accounts are deliberately managed by an extension using a function_selector and params according to the specific expectations and business requirements.
//!
//! [`sign_operation`](../src/transmitter_common/protocol_extension.rs.html#15-21)
//!
//! Provides additional signatures when the transaction contains AccountMetas marked as signers.
//!
//! [`get_compute_budget`](../src/transmitter_common/protocol_extension.rs.html#23)
//!
//! Enables the increase of the compute budget for the operation currently being executed.
//!
//! ### Making a proposal
//!
//! The associated program can do more than just receive and execute operations; it can also send a proposal
//! to the destination chain if it is registered as a proposer. Here is how the
//! [onefunc associated program](../onefunc/index.html) makes a proposal
//!
//! ```rust
//!let protocol_id: Vec<u8> = PROTOCOL_ID.to_vec();
//!let dst_chain_id = 33133_u128;
//!let protocol_address: Vec<u8> = vec![1; 20];
//!let function_selector: Vec<u8> = b"ask1234mkl;1mklasdfasm;lkasdmf__".to_vec();
//!let params: Vec<u8> = b"an arbitrary data".to_vec();
//!
//!let cpi_program = ctx.accounts.photon_program.to_account_info();
//!let cpi_accounts = Propose {
//!    proposer: ctx.accounts.proposer.to_account_info(),
//!    config: ctx.accounts.config.to_account_info(),
//!    protocol_info: ctx.accounts.protocol_info.to_account_info(),
//!};
//!let bump = [ctx.bumps.proposer];
//!let proposer_seeds = [ROOT, b"PROPOSER", &bump[..]];
//!let bindings = &[&proposer_seeds[..]][..];
//!let ctx = CpiContext::new_with_signer(cpi_program, cpi_accounts, bindings);
//!
//!photon::cpi::propose(
//!    ctx,
//!    protocol_id,
//!    dst_chain_id,
//!    protocol_address,
//!    function_selector,
//!    params,
//!)
//! ```
